# BlocksAway

Welcome to Blocks Away! A Short Puzzle Platformer with wacky mechanics and limited control!

If you're having trouble understanding the mechanics, please read below:

The Left and Right buttons move the character to their corresponding direction.

Upon running out of control points, the character will mindlessly run in whatever direction their facing. If the character runs into a wall during the mindless state, the character is forced to turn around.

While you can control the character, you can fall through holes. During the mindless phase, the character will automatically jump if the ground block in front of him is missing.

There are a few bugs that I was unable to catch by the end of the jam (A big one being the menu and restart button not working on level 7)



This game was created for the 2020 GMTK GameJam. The Theme of the Jam was "Out Of Control". Here's my interpretation of it!

I worked on the game alone.
